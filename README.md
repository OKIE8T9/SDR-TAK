SDR-TAK is a rugged, field-deployable RF appliance built around a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and a RAK19003 Meshtastic node. It provides local aircraft situational awareness via a self-hosted WLAN, while broadcasting distilled alerts over the local meshtastic network.
The system runs fully offline, exposing a Virtual Radar Server (VRS) web interface over a private Wi-Fi access point, allowing nearby phones or tablets to view live ADS-B aircraft data without internet connectivity. Aircraft events and alerts can be selectively forwarded over Meshtastic for long-range, low-power dissemination and ATAK integration.
Designed for low power draw, resilience, and field use, SDR-TAK is powered by a UPS-buffered battery system, uses external antennas for increased RF performance, and avoids cloud dependencies. It is intended for experimentation, emergency response, and situational awareness in the field.
